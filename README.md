# Beat Saber AudioLink
this is literally a port from Udon Audio Link in VRC.
It's the same thing.
It will work the exact same in Beat Saber as it would in VRC, and will work universally across all avatars, platforms, sabers, or really any other asset that uses an Audio Link compatible shader.
It will use the lights and boost colors from the users custom colours to create a colour theme, or reference the maps custom colors when available.
